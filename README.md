# Danfoss_101N0500_Aduino
Replacement controller for Danfoss 101N0500 12volt fridge using an Aduino.

Create your own Danfoss controller with this project. I found this 12v camping fridge on the side of the road. The original thermister had broken. I beleive the thermister was a 1k NTC. Instead of buying a replacement part im spending many hours and double(?) the money making my own controller! I cant resist a challenge.
